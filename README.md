# How It Works
## Chat Flow
- User asks a question
- PDFs are searched via RAG
- Groq LLM generates a context-aware response

## Booking Flow
- User says “I want to book”
Assistant collects:
Name
Email
Date
Time
Booking is summarized
User confirms
Booking is saved to DB
Confirmation email is sent

## PDF Knowledge Base (RAG)
- Upload PDFs from the UI
- PDFs are embedded and indexed
- AI answers questions only using uploaded knowledge

## Admin Dashboard
- View all bookings
- Monitor system usage
- Accessible from the bottom of the app
